# Game Brainstorming: Project Star

Joshua Rechkemmer

## Scene

The game takes place in a sterile space station where there are numerous science experiments taking place throughout the facility, and the facility is filled with many different types of robots and AI that maintain and run the facility. The game takes place in a futuristic science fiction world, and in this facility, astrological events such as supernovas and blackholes are being recreated. However the space station is partially destroyed, so some parts of the facility are sealed off with bulkheads, sparking with exposed wires, or even are completely destroyed and lack functionality such as power, oxygen, and pressure.

## Setting

This a space station after humanity has discovered and mastered space flight, and the station is supposed to study and then recreate and experiment the application of astrological events such as supernovas and blackholes. The facility is run by an AI whose directive is to run the facility and preserve the data collected no matter the cost.

## Character

The protagonist is a nameless and silent protagonist who was a tester for the many of the experiments, and they are only referenced by other characters by their title, tester. They only want to escape the dying space station, but they are forced by the AI running the facility to reach the core of the facility to retrieve the backup of the data.

## Character Progression

To get to the end of each level, the tester has to use the Astro Gun, that fires miniature supernovas and blackholes, to manipulate crates and other items to activate buttons and create pathways.

As the tester progresses through the game, the station becomes more defunct and broken. They would start out in their testing labs where they tested the Astro Gun that are in their functional glory, and then the station would become more and more nonfunctional where power, air, and pressure are out. They might even need to go out to open space to reach a part of the station.

Gameplay wise, the mechanics would be introduced one at a time. First the tester would start out with nothing to solve the puzzles. Then they would be given the Astro Gun, but it only has the supernova functionality. Then in the next section the blackhole functionality would be introduced, and any other mechanics would be introduced similiarly.
